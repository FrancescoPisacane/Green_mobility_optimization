        "Consider a long linear cycle path  as Vento (VENezia-TOrino), or the Danube cycle path. The cycle path usually runs along the banks of a river with scarse tourist interest. However, from the main course of the cycle path it is possible to reach places of tourist interest by making small detours.  \n",

        "The rapid growth of e-bike ridership is proposing the problem of deploying a suitable charging infrastructure. The charging stations should be placed in strategic positions so as to guarantee a coverage of the whole cycle path. However, since the charging operations require a non negligible time, the charging station should be positioned in places where alternative activities could be carried out, as restaurants, museums, swimming pool, or other amenities. These places, called **Points of Interest (POI)**  are not on the main trajectory of the cyclepath, but the bikers must deviate to reach them.\n",
